# Scavenging & suction

---

# Anaesthetic gas scavenging system (AGSS)

Reduce environmental anaesthetic gas concentrations by collecting waste gases and venting outside the building.

Arbitrary UK legal limits: N<sub>2</sub>O ≤ 100ppm; Isoflurane ≤ 50 ppm

Components:
1. Collection
2. Transfer
3. Receiving
4. Disposal

---

# 1. Collection system

<img data-src="connector.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Connects to APL valve outlet or scavenging connector on anaesthetic machine

**30mm connector** to avoid accidental cross-connection with breathing system

---

# 2. Transfer system

<img data-src="hose.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Corrugated plastic hose connecting collection and receiving systems

---

# 3. Receiving system

## Open (active)

Reservoir with mesh-covered opening: allows compensation for variations in expiratory flow without generating positive/negative pressures.

## Closed (passive)

Length of tubing with positive (+5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and negative (-0.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) pressure relief valves.

Reservoir bag accommodates small changes in pressure without requiring valve opening.

## Closed receiving

# 4. Disposal

- Active:
 - Vacuum system
 - High flow (>100 L/min), low-pressure
- Passive:
 - "Hole in the wall"
 - Tubing directly vented to the atmosphere

---

# Considerations

Scavenging does not prevent environmental pollution

Theatre ventilation systems further reduce ambient anaesthetic gas concentrations

---

# Medical vacuum & suction

High pressure, low flow system: –53 kPa (–400 mmHg) with 40 L/min flow

Types:
- Wall suction outlets from central vacuum plant
- Portable units (e.g. Laerdal)

One vacuum outlet in anaesthetic room; two in theatre (one dedicated for anaesthetic use)

Described in **gauge pressure** (relative to atmospheric pressure) therefore cannot exceed –101 kPa
