[Thoracoscore](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2006.09.020) is a scoring system to predict the in-patient mortality of patients undergoing thoracic surgery.

Whilst working in thoracic surgery, I noticed that the most commonly used[^1] "web calculator" provided by [Société Française d’Anesthésie et de Réanimation](http://www.sfar.org/scores2/thoracoscore2.php) had a small systematic error in its results.

I presented these findings at the [2012 annual meeting](http://www.scts.org/_userfiles/pages/file/Annual%20Meetings/SCTS%2012%20Final%20Prog%20v4.pdf) of the [Society for Cardiothoracic Surgey in Great Britain & Ireland](http://www.scts.org/annual_meeting/).
