As part of an MSc project, I'm investigating whether [Phosphodiesterase-5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDE5) inhibitors are useful in preventing and treating [High Altitude Pulmonary Oedema](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude_pulmonary_edema) (HAPE).

This is a presentation of a literature review, given to fellow MSc students.
