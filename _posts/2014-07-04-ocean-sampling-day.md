The Austral winter solstice on 21st June was not only Midwinter's Day, but also [Ocean Sampling Day](http://oceansamplingday.org) (OSD): a simultaneous sampling of the world’s oceans at [167 different sites](https://mb3is.megx.net/osd-registry/list) around the globe.

These water samples, taken at identical times, will provide insights into fundamental rules describing microbial diversity and function – the tiny organisms in the sea upon which all other marine life depends.

[Sabrina Heiser](http://penguinlandadventures.blogspot.com), one of our friendly local marine biologists, organised Rothera's participation in OSD and took a camera along[^1].

[^1]: As a nod to Sabrina's nationality, we also produced a [German version](https://vimeo.com/98787966).
