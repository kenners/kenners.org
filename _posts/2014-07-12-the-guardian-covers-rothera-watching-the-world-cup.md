_[The Guardian's](http://www.theguardian.com)_ [Ian Sample](https://twitter.com/iansample):

>Never mind the sub-zero temperatures, the barren landscape, the 20 hours of darkness each day, and the fact that the internet is so glacial it would take several days to download a single game. Out at the Rothera research station on the Antarctic peninsula, to follow the World Cup means huddling around the radio.

Maybe a little harsh in the description of the environment, but spot on assessment of our internet connection.
