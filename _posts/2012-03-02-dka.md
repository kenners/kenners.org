[Diabetic ketoacidosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_ketoacidosis) (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus, that can occur in unwell Type-1 diabetics.

I presented on two patients who had an episode of DKA following orthopaedic surgery. This is significant, as DKA should be preventable in these circumstances. This was presented at a [clinical governance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_governance) meeting at the [Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital](http://www.nnuh.nhs.uk).
