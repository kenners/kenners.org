Rose Drew, current doctor at Rothera:

> Docschool is the name given to the regular sessions that I (and many Rothera doctors before me) run over winter with the aim of training my fellow winterers in some useful medical skills.  As a sole medical practitioner, having another pair of hands that knows what they are doing is invaluable.

Cross-training FTW.
