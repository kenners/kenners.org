I'm currently manning one of BAS's forward operating bases which is located on the edge of King George VI Sound, about halfway down the coast of Alexander Island, and serves as a weather station and refuelling depot for [Twin Otters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter) en-route to [Sky-Blu](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/skyblu).
