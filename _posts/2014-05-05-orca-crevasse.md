We've had a run of poor weather over the last few weeks, but yesterday it finally cleared up for a spell. After brunch, five of us headed out to explore Orca Crevasse â€“ around 6km off base.

Whilst it's great to get some recreation, winter trips like this also serve as a training opportunity: it's good to practice basic crevasse rescue techniques in a benign environment before doing it for real.
