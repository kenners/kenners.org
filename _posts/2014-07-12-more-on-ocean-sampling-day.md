[Sabrina Heiser](http://penguinlandadventures.blogspot.com) gives [an account](http://oceansamplingday.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/ocean-sampling-day-in-antarctic-this.html) of Rothera's contribution to [Ocean Sampling Day](http://oceansamplingday.org):

> When we left base in our RIB it was still snowing and it took us quite a while to push through the pancake ice but we finally got to Site 1. The fast ice edge was just where we wanted to sample which was good as it was slightly too windy and we would have drifted quite a lot. However, we found a little bay and were able to throw an anchor onto the ice to stop us from drifting. During the 2 Â½ hours we were out there, the weather cleared up and it turned into a quite beautiful day.
