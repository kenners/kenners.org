Following on from some [climbing on North Stork](/post/climbing-north-stork) last month, Alex (one of the Field Assistants) led a weekend walk up along the Stork Traverse, a route that took us scrambling to the tops of North, Middle, and South Stork.

We started out with great weather, but then as often happens here, the weather closed in leaving us with <50m visibility for the second half - not much potential for photos on the way down!
