It's Midwinter's Day in the southern hemisphere, and in Antarctica this is treated as an (inter)national holiday.

We'll be celebrating with an eight course(!) meal later in the day, after listening to the annual [Antarctic Midwinter Broadcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p021bmjc) on the BBC World Service.

From all of us Rothera station at 67ÂºS, a very happy midwinter to you!
