Summer has definitely arrived here at Rothera, transforming it into a land of the midnight sun, with an increasing amount of inquisitive wildlife.

For the past couple of weeks, elephant seals have been regular visitors to the station, gradually getting bolder and bolder at moving further into base. One of their favourite spots is the middle of the runway, where they like to bask in the sun â€“ causing a temporary halt in air operations until one of the ground crew chases them away on a tractor.

Whilst taking an evening walk around the point, I saw my first Adelie penguins of the season, which tend to be the predominant species that visit Rothera, although occasionally Emperors do make an appearance.
